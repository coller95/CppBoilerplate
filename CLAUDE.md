```

### Output Modes
The build system supports two output modes:
- **Human Mode (VERBOSE=1)**: Colorful, detailed output with emojis and progress indicators
- **Agent Mode (VERBOSE=0)**: Ultra-concise, structured output optimized for AI processing

Set via environment variable or command argument:
```bash
VERBOSE=1 make debug               # Human-friendly build
VERBOSE=0 make debug               # Agent-friendly build
./scripts/test.sh human            # Human-friendly test script
./scripts/test.sh agent            # Agent-friendly test script
```

### Module Generation
```bash
# Create new modules using generation scripts
./scripts/create_endpoint.sh create EndpointName    # HTTP endpoints
./scripts/create_service.sh create ServiceName      # Business logic services  
./scripts/create_module.sh create ModuleName        # Utility/infrastructure modules

# Remove modules safely with confirmation
./scripts/create_endpoint.sh remove EndpointName
./scripts/create_service.sh remove ServiceName
./scripts/create_module.sh remove ModuleName
```

## **CRITICAL: Test-Driven Development (TDD) Requirements**

‚ö†Ô∏è **MANDATORY TDD DISCIPLINE** - This project strictly enforces Test-Driven Development:

1. **RED-GREEN-REFACTOR CYCLE**:
   - üî¥ **RED**: Write failing test first (`make test-run-ModuleName`)
   - üü¢ **GREEN**: Write minimal code to make test pass
   - üîµ **REFACTOR**: Improve code while keeping tests green

2. **STRICT RULES**:
   - **NEVER write implementation code without a failing test first**
   - **NO exceptions** - applies to new features, bug fixes, and refactoring
   - Tests must be comprehensive and cover edge cases
   - All auto-registration functionality must be verified in tests

3. **TDD WORKFLOW**:
   ```bash
   # 1. Create failing test in tests/ModuleNameTest/cases/
   make test-run-ModuleName  # Should fail (RED)
   
   # 2. Implement minimal code to pass
   make test-run-ModuleName  # Should pass (GREEN)
   
   # 3. Refactor and ensure tests still pass
   make test-run-ModuleName  # Should remain green (REFACTOR)
   ```

4. **WHY TDD IS MANDATORY**:
   - Ensures robust, testable architecture
   - Prevents regression bugs
   - Documents expected behavior
   - Enables confident refactoring
   - Maintains code quality at scale

## High-Level Architecture

This project uses a **modular monolithic architecture** with the following key principles:

### Core Architecture Components

**Application Class (`src/main.cpp`)**: The main application orchestrates:
- IoC Container initialization and service registration
- WebServer configuration and startup
- ApiRouter initialization for HTTP endpoint management
- Service lifecycle management (startup, shutdown)

**IoC Container (`IocContainer/`)**: Dependency injection container that:
- Manages service registration and resolution
- Supports singleton and instance-based services
- Enables loose coupling and testability
- Provides service discovery and type management

**WebServer (`WebServer/`)**: HTTP server abstraction that:
- Supports pluggable backends (currently Mongoose)
- Integrates with ApiRouter for request routing
- Provides factory pattern for backend selection
- Handles MIME types, static content, and JSON responses

**ApiRouter (`ApiRouter/`)**: API endpoint management system that:
- Manages HTTP endpoint registration and routing
- Supports automatic module registration
- Provides global access to registered endpoints
- Integrates seamlessly with WebServer for request handling

**Logger (`Logger/`)**: Comprehensive logging system that:
- Supports both local display and remote logging
- Integrates with IoC container for dependency injection
- Provides structured logging with different severity levels
- Handles connection failures gracefully

### Module Organization Principles

**One Module, One Responsibility**: Each module has a clear, single purpose:
- **Endpoints** (`EndpointHello/`): Handle specific HTTP requests
- **Services**: Implement business logic with IoC integration
- **Infrastructure**: Provide system-level functionality (WebServer, Logger)

**Interface-Based Design**: All modules implement clear interfaces:
- `ILogger`, `IWebServer`, `IWebServerBackend`, `IApiRouter`
- Enables mocking and testing isolation
- Supports dependency injection patterns

**Auto-Registration Pattern**: Services and endpoints automatically register:
- Endpoints register with ApiRouter during initialization
- Services register with IoC Container
- No manual wiring required in main application

**Test Isolation**: Each module has comprehensive, isolated test suites:
- Tests in `tests/ModuleNameTest/cases/` subdirectories
- Mock implementations for all interfaces
- Verification of auto-registration functionality

### Build System Architecture

**Immutable Makefile Design**: Core build logic never changes:
- Main `Makefile` contains generic build patterns
- `Project.build` contains project-specific source/library configuration
- `Platform.build` handles cross-compilation and architecture detection
- `Tests.build` provides test-related targets at project level

**Flexible Test Framework**: Each test module uses configurable Makefiles:
- Dependencies specified declaratively: `DEPENDENCIES = Logger IocContainer`
- Special folder handling: `ModuleName:FolderName` format
- External library support via `EXTERNAL_SOURCES`, `EXTERNAL_INCLUDES`, `EXTERNAL_LIBS`
- Automatic compilation rules and object file organization

**Dual-Mode Output System**: Optimized for both humans and AI agents:
- Human mode: Colorful, descriptive output with comprehensive error context
- Agent mode: Ultra-concise, structured output for AI context efficiency
- Consistent prefixes: `[BUILD]`, `[TEST]`, `[SCRIPT]`

### External Dependencies

**Google Test Framework** (`external/googletest/`): Complete testing infrastructure
- Integrated with all test modules via build system
- Includes Google Mock for dependency mocking
- Configured in `bootstrap.sh` for automatic setup

**Mongoose Web Server** (`external/mongoose/`): HTTP server backend
- C library with C++ wrapper integration
- Source-based inclusion for cross-platform compatibility
- Abstracted through WebServer interface for pluggability

### Development Workflow Integration

**Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: **MANDATORY** for all code changes and implementations:
- **ALWAYS write failing tests FIRST** before any implementation code
- Tests must be written in `cases/` subdirectories for each module
- Implement **minimal code only** to make tests pass (Red-Green-Refactor cycle)
- Use `make test-run-ModuleName` for rapid TDD iteration
- **NO CODE CHANGES WITHOUT TESTS** - this is a strict requirement
- Comprehensive test coverage including auto-registration verification
- All new features, bug fixes, and refactoring must follow TDD discipline

**Module Generation Scripts**: Consistent structure across all modules:
- `create_endpoint.sh`: HTTP endpoints with ApiRouter integration
- `create_service.sh`: Business services with IoC registration
- `create_module.sh`: Utility modules with interface/implementation patterns

**Enhanced Test Management**: Comprehensive test operations from project root:
- Individual module testing without changing directories
- Project-wide statistics and debugging information
- Intelligent error handling with module name suggestions

### Key Architectural Benefits

**High Cohesion, Low Coupling**: Each module is self-contained but integrates cleanly:
- Clear interfaces enable swappable implementations
- Dependency injection eliminates hard dependencies
- Auto-registration reduces boilerplate and manual wiring

**TDD-First Testability**: Every component designed through Test-Driven Development:
- **ALL code written following RED-GREEN-REFACTOR TDD cycle**
- Interface-based design enables complete mocking and test isolation
- Test isolation prevents cross-module interference
- Auto-registration verification catches integration issues
- **Tests written BEFORE implementation ensures robust design**

**Scalability**: Architecture supports growing complexity:
- New modules integrate automatically via established patterns
- Test framework scales with configurable dependency management
- Build system handles increasing source file complexity

**Developer Experience**: Tooling optimized for rapid development:
- Generation scripts eliminate boilerplate and ensure consistency
- Dual-mode output adapts to human vs. automated workflows
- Enhanced test management provides comprehensive project visibility

This architecture enables rapid development of new features while maintaining high code quality, comprehensive test coverage, and clear separation of concerns across all system components.

## **FINAL TDD REMINDER**
